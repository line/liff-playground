# LIFF Playground

This is a web application that allows you to try out the basic features of the [LINE Front-end Framework (LIFF)](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/overview/). For example, you can deploy the following playground to your server.

* [LIFF Playground](https://liff-playground.netlify.app)

## Preparation

### 1. Get a LIFF ID

To start the LIFF Playground, you need to obtain a LIFF ID from the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/). Follow the steps below to obtain a LIFF ID.

* [Create a channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/getting-started/)
* [Adding a LIFF app to your channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/)

### 2. Set the LIFF ID

Set the LIFF ID obtained in the above procedure as an environment variable. Open `.env` and set the LIFF ID.

````
VITE_LIFF_ID="Your LIFF ID"
````

## Usage

This section shows two ways to run it on local and deploy it on a server.

### Run on local

To run the LIFF Playground on local, first install the dependent packages. Then run the application.

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

This will start it up. When you access the URL shown in the terminal, you can see the LIFF Playground.

### Deploy to a server

This section shows an example of deploying LIFF Playground to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Install the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) beforehand.

The following commands will build the source code and deploy it to Netlify.

```bash
$ netlify build
$ netlify deploy --prod
```

After executing the above, the LIFF Playground will be deployed on Netlify. And the URL of the deployed page will be displayed in the terminal.

Then register this URL on the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/). Register this URL as the `Endpoint URL` in the LIFF app settings page. See [Adding a LIFF app to your channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/) for instructions on how to register.

That's it! The LIFF Playground will appear when you access the deployed URL. You can confirm that LINE Login and other features work properly.
